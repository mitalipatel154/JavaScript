## 🛠 Features & Logic

### 1️⃣ Ordering System
- **Menu Options:**
  - Coffee → ₹50
  - Tea → ₹30
  - Sandwich → ₹80
  - Pastry → ₹100
- Keeps track of:
  - Total items ordered
  - Subtotal price
  - Highest, lowest, and average item price

---

### 2️⃣ Discount System
- **Logic:**
  - Bill > ₹1000 → 20% discount  
  - Bill > ₹500 → 10% discount  
  - Otherwise → No discount  

---

### 3️⃣ GST & Final Bill
- **GST:** 5% added after discount  
- **Final Bill = (Subtotal - Discount) + GST**

---

### 4️⃣ Café Report
- Total items sold
- Highest price item
- Lowest price item
- Average price per item

---

### 5️⃣ Change Password System
- **Input:** Old password, new password, confirm password  
- **Logic:**
  - New password ≠ Old password  
  - New password = Confirm password  
  - If valid → Password updated successfully
